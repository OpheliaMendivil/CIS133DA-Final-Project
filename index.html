       As a fellow tranwoman experiencing all to do with transition MTF, I feel the need to share advice/resources in hopes of helping others. Considering that transgender people's rights continue to be ignored or discriminated, it can become difficult to find the proper needed assitance. Personally I come from a family who is not very supportive which arrises the many risks of coming out. Lots of people are constantly being kicked from there homes due to their identity. With that in mind I brought together a collection of resources that I myself found extremely useful.
