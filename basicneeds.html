      <h5>
      Joshua Tree was started in 1988 to provide a safe environment where people living with HIV/AIDS can come to share experiences, mutual support and enjoy a nourishing selection of food and grocery items to take home. From this humble beginning, Joshua Tree has grown into a well-established and committed AIDS service organization that serves the nutritional needs of a diverse, ever-growing and supportive membership. Our clients also have the opportunity to socialize in a compassionate and caring atmosphere, make new friends, and get needed health-related and local HIV/AIDS services information.
