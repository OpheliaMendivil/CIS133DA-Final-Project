     <u><h2>
      Texas isn’t the only state denying essential medical care to trans youths
    </h2></u>
      <h5>
      In February 2022, governor Greg Abbott (R) issue a letter to Texas state health agencies saying that transgender children receiving gender affirming medal care would now quality as a form of child abuse. Subsequently allowing and requiring doctors, teachers, and other caregivers to report parents who help their children through a medical transition to the DFPS.
This move is at the forefront of an ever growing trend by conservative politicians to directly target LGBT+ youth and course harm through anti-trans legislation. 
Fear mongering and misrepresentation of trans youth and people as a whole had lead to Texas to passage of this bill into law, showing that the grown adults in office would rather put children’s lives on the line than allow them access to life saving care.
Several states have also introduced proposals to restrict trans peoples access to sports teams as well as health care, and prohibit public educators from discussing LGBT+ issues entirely. The ACLU sued Texas in hope of preventing implementation, and a Texas judge has partially blocked enforcement.

      Texas judge blocks investigations into trans youth care
    </h2>
      <h5>
        Any Clark Meachum successfully blocked state agencies from investigating the parent of a 16 year old trans girl who were being investigated for providing her access to gender confirming care. Nine other similar investigations of so called “child abused” through gender confirming care have been also been opened. Lamda Legal, which along with the American Civil Liberties Union sued on behalf of the 16-year-old, hailed the ruling Friday. Lamda Legal and the ACLU sued on behalf of the 16 year old stating that, "Parents who love their transgender children and work with healthcare providers to support and affirm their well-being should be celebrated, rather than investigated as criminals as the state sought to do here," Legals senior counselor Paul Castillo also strongly made clear that "… no one who counts as a mandatory reporter can be forced to turn in families for investigation simply for doing what is right for their child." The fight against anti-trans legislation will continue.
